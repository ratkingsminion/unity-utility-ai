TODO
* Documentation

DISCUSSION
* Alarming / "Swarm"-AI -> one queen-bee AI, several sub AIs? better: "neurons" that fire to the next/nearest AIs
* How to model X and (Y or Z)? -> AIConsiderationSelector
* Multi-Actions? [Better not, as they often change the player's state. Use SubAIActions for that.]
